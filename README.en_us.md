# All Improvement Originates from Human Flaws

## How We Think

* The human brain is serial and cannot effectively parallel process multiple threads.
  * The brain is not suited for thinking about parallel execution of multiple threads.
    * **[Single Thread]** Change the programming model of shared variables to a transactional commit model.
  * The brain struggles with thinking about multiple independent business processes displayed on the screen simultaneously.
    * Code is organized by occurrence time, and code that is together may not be logically related business processes.
      * **[Split Files by Business]** Readers should be able to track by their task goals, rather than assuming all logic triggered by a button click must be in one large file.
      * **[Split Files by Change Frequency]** Code should be organized by the frequency of business changes. Code that changes together should be grouped together.
  * The brain finds it difficult to manage multiple independent mutable states; essentially, each independent changing state is like a separate thread.
    * Three main factors driving the increase in state entropy:
      * Due to interaction experience requirements, from backend to rich clients to 3D animations, states are replicated in multiple copies, increasingly closer to the display layer.
      * Due to physical hardware constraints, memory goes from CPU unified addressing to heterogeneous computing, CUDA, where each hardware core has its own layer of memory.
      * Due to data volume growth, from unified OLAP databases to Data Lakes and Data Marts, data is replicated in increasingly many copies, and pipelines get longer.
    * Countermeasures against the increase in state entropy:
      * **[Declarative Data Linkage]** Reduce independently changing states, expressing derived states through expressions.
      * **[Global Virtual Data Layer]** Draw inspiration from Unix's unified file abstraction to introduce a unified virtual data layer. Convert as much state as possible into cache.
  * The brain finds it difficult to understand drastic changes to existing behaviors and prefers incremental and stable additions, essentially "controlling variables."
    * The biggest difficulty with CSS is its non-orthogonality; adding one rule can have unexpected effects.
      * **[Localized Layout]** SwiftUI's HStack/VStack/ZStack layout rules are few in number, and each rule's effect is local and stable.
    * Performance optimization often requires breaking locality, as local autonomy can lead to redundant work.
      * **[Localized IO]** System automatically implements batch I/O optimizations that can be automated globally.
      * **[Localized IO]** Write business logic as autonomous, but allow additional manual global tuning, rather than forcing business logic to be extracted locally.

## How We Perceive

* Human eyes can only gather information in a narrow field of view.
  * Human perception of time comes from spatial perception.
  * People prefer to get information in a top-to-bottom temporal order from early to late on a single screen.
    * The callback programming model breaks the direct mapping of on-screen order and temporal order.
      * **[Coroutine-style IO]** Replace callbacks with coroutines to straighten out the code on the screen.
    * Business state machines driven by status fields break the direct mapping of on-screen order and temporal order.
      * **[Coroutine-style Business Processes]** Replace status state machines with coroutines to straighten out the code on the screen.
  * Due to field of view limitations, source code can't display all details.
    * Type definitions, memory allocations, and other "details" occupy a lot of visual space.
      * **[IDE Detail Hiding]** Omit details in text, let the IDE complete them, and display them only when the mouse hovers over them.
    * The most familiar way for humans to organize space is still hierarchical folders.
      * All "architectural" designs ultimately involve folders and files. However, a single-dimensional static index (nested folders) cannot satisfy all possible search needs.
        * **[IDE On-Demand Indexing]** Let the IDE complete indexing that folder classifications cannot satisfy, designing IDE indexes according to the reader's task.
  * Rod cells in the eyes easily overlook differences in shape and order but are more sensitive to color.
    * Syntax highlighting takes up valuable resources but does not consider the reader's needs.
      * **[IDE On-Demand Highlighting]** For different tasks, readers want to find different focus points. Syntax highlighting should be combined with tasks.

## How We Collaborate

* The most efficient way for people to communicate is face-to-face interactive sound wave vibrations.
  * The low bandwidth of human communication fundamentally limits the size of a team.
    * The faster the deployment speed required, the diminishing marginal benefits of adding people.
      * Reduce meetings and synchronizations; teams should be as autonomous as possible, not relying on feature teams for horizontal coordination.
        * High cohesion, low coupling.
          * **[Static Linking Package]** Programming tools should offer more combination possibilities, rather than implementing all combinations at runtime with object-oriented polymorphism.
          * **[Split Packages by Change Frequency]** Division of labor should be based on change frequency, and the division should be clear.
  * Problems should be solved by end-users or teams close to them, rather than long-distance transmission of requirements.
    * End-user programming: Let the person who raises the demand implement it directly.
      * Incorporate "learning" into tools; a teaching tool needs to be built in.
        * The development of end-user programming tools is difficult and costly, exceeding the return on a single software.
          * **[Editor Preset]** Preset common shared demands such as "formula editing" and "shop decoration."
      * The goal of teaching tools is education, not to be benchmarked as more advanced productivity.
        * **[Teaching Built-in]** Provide seamless switching between teaching mode and productivity mode.
    * Low-code programming: By presetting in advance, workload is front-loaded, reducing the scale of application developers, thus embedding developers within user organizations in the organizational structure. This is in contrast to document-driven outsourcing development.
      * "Presetting" comes from the advance prediction of common needs.
        * **[Cloudization of Non-functional Requirements]** The implementation of non-functional requirements all run on similar machines.
          * Operating systems
          * Kubernetes (k8s)
          * RPC frameworks
        * Developers are human.
          * Programming tools
          * Communication tools
        * Users are human.
          * **[SaaS Components]** IM / Telephone / SMS
          * **[UI Components]** Word processors / Spreadsheets
          * **[CRUD Generation]** Usual displays and interactions
            * List details
            * Hierarchical tree
            * Table structure
            * Draggable whiteboard
        * **[SaaS Components]** Relatively stable business processes
          * Login / Registration
          * Payment
        * Relatively stable business common processes within the industry
          * E-commerce
          * HR / Recruitment
          * Sales Management / CRM

## How We Learn

* Human "induction/understanding/learning" ability highly depends on visual interactive manipulation and feedback.
  * Help should be placed where the task is executed; it's less about "visualization" and more about "discoverability."
    * **[Turn Fill-in-the-Blank into Multiple Choice]** Standalone syntax manuals are ineffective; interface buttons must be provided to turn fill-in-the-blank into multiple-choice, thus inspiring learning.
      * GUI designers / Shop decoration
      * Formula editors
      *

 Approval / Workflow designers
      * Trigger process designers
  * People are accustomed to touching an object and then observing its feedback to induce learning.
    * Unobservable behaviors cannot be learned.
      * How can I find patterns if bugs in the production environment cannot be reproduced locally?
        * **[TestInProduction]** Tracing, extensive tracing, and traffic playback.
      * How can I do anything about bugs in low-code platforms without any clues, other than asking the platform developers?
        * Users cannot be expected to understand all internal details; the "platform" must be reliable.
        * Locating business logic issues and production environment bugs relies on tracing.
    * The negative feelings people have towards behaviors with slow feedback increase exponentially.
      * My local machine is too slow to run; I need to use the company's sandbox environment to reproduce problems.
        * **[Cloud IDE]**
      * After changing the code, I need to recompile and reload.
        * **[LanguageServer]** Skip unnecessary compilation during interactive development.
        * **[What You See Is What You Get]** WYSIWYG GUI development essentially uses an interpreter to execute, trading off reduced compilation time.
        * **[HMR]** Maintain page state during reloading.

# no code / low code / pro code

# No Code / Low Code / Pro Code

All improvement originates from human flaws.

* **No Code**: Programming for oneself, giving users the feel of a more powerful office/utility software. The main approach is to use graphical operations and other means to lower the learning curve. No code must target very specific domains to be effective.
* **Low Code**: Programming for others, creating the concept of a 'citizen developer'. The main approach is the platform's presetting of common demands, reducing the need to write code from scratch. Low code also targets specific domains to allow the platform to predict needs in advance, but compared to no code, it does not need to restrict usage scenarios as rigidly.
* **Pro Code**: Low code platforms do not choose low code to create the platform itself because low code does not reduce the cost of building a system from scratch. However, pro code platforms do choose pro code to create the platform itself. For example, React developers would use React to create their development tools because pro code tools and platforms aim to fundamentally reduce the complexity of building a system from scratch.
